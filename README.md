Welcome dear miner! You've signed up to this death sentence exciting new mission just for you! To fufil your quota, you must dig beneath an alien planet and uncover enough Illumanium - a crystaline mineral that immits a vibrant light. Pick up gold along the way and call down a drop pod to retrive the crystals - and you. 

However, there are twisted creatures that reside within the dark, they fear the light, but will their fear outweigh their hunger? Continue to dig and encounter alien horrors none many have lived to tell tales about! 

And don't worry we're not sending a first-time miner like you to go grab some mysterious multiverse artifact all for the purpose of exposition! Instead you'll likely die within 5 minutes, good luck miner!
